Time is money; time is Cardiac Muscle Cells.

There is a saying, "time is money"; however, during heart attack/myocardial infarction, time is a heart muscle cell, every second counts when it’s a heart attack.

A heart attack is a sudden blockage of blood flow to heart muscle(1, 2). The heart muscle cannot get the nutrients and oxygen supply required to function adequately; therefore, health muscle cell starts to suffocate and gradually leads to symptoms such as chest pain or discomfort, heartburn, nausea, sweating, and more.

Call 120 right-away if you have symptoms —the earlier the treatment, the better the outcome.

Don't wait for symptoms to "go away." Early recognition and treatment of a heart attack can reduce the risk of heart damage.

Even if you're not sure the symptoms are of heart attack, get evaluated. The best time to treat a heart attack is within one hour of the first symptoms onset(1, 2). Waiting just a couple of hours for medical help may limit your treatment options, increase the amount of damage to your heart muscle and reduce your chance of survival.

Definition of heart attack?

A heart attack/myocardial infarction (MI) is permanent damage to the heart muscle. "Myo" means muscle, "cardial" refers to the heart, and "infarction" means the death of tissue due to lack of blood supply.

Mechanism


A heart attack happens when one or more of your coronary arteries suddenly becomes blocked, stopping blood flow to the heart muscle and damaging it – causing a heart attack. Coronary arteries are a network of blood vessels that surround the heart

muscle and supply it with blood rich in oxygen and nutrients. Heart muscles

needs this continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients to function efficiently. Over time, one or more of the coronary arteries narrow because of a buildup of

cholesterol and fatty deposits (called plaque) on the inner walls, a condition

called coronary artery disease. When blood flow to the heart muscle cells is restricted,

this can cause chest pain called angina. When one or more of the coronaries

arteries are completely blocked; a heart attack may occur.

Symptoms of a heart attack include

A study on awareness of Heart attack by Health Interview Survey (NHIS), data from 2014 found that 47.2% of U.S. adults could state all five common heart attack symptoms (jaw, neck, or back discomfort; weakness or light, headedness; chest discomfort; arm or shoulder discomfort; and shortness of breath) and knew to call 9-1-1 if someone had a heart attack.



图片In 2008, 2014, and 2017, the survey asked questions about symptoms of a heart attack and the best action to take when someone was thought to be having a heart attack. Five yes/no questions assessed whether the respondent was aware of these five symptoms of heart attack: 1) pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck or back; 2) feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint; 3) chest pain or discomfort; 4) pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulder; and 5) shortness of breath. Respondents were then asked, “If you thought someone was having a heart attack, what is the best thing to do right away?” The appropriate response was “Call 9-1-1” (or another emergency number). During the three years, the study concluded that, adjusted percentage of all survey respondents aware of the five common heart attack symptoms increased from 39.6% in 2008, to 50.0% in 2014, and to 50.2% in 2017, with corresponding p-value for difference <0.001 (Table 1). Similar increases were observed in the unadjusted percentages and in all subgroups by demographic characteristics and CVD risk factors, except among those with four or five CVD risk factors. In 2017, knowledge of the five heart attack symptoms was lower among men, younger age groups, racial/ethnic minorities (especially non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanics), and persons with lower levels of educational attainment than among women, older adults, non-Hispanic whites, and adults with at least a high school education.

Diagnosis and clinical test of MI

Once the emergency care team arrives, they will ask you about your symptoms and begin to evaluate you. Many tests may be ordered to determine if you have experienced a heart attack. These include:


(a).12-lead ECG: This is one of the initial tests that will be done. Frequently paramedics or nurses will do this on-site or on the way to the hospital. The 12-lead ECG (also known as EKG or electrocardiogram) can help to tell what type of heart attack and where it has occurred.Besides, heart rate and rhythm can be monitored. The patient will also be connected with leads (wires) to a bedside monitor for continuous monitoring of your heart rate and rhythm.


(b)Blood studies: Blood may be drawn to measure levels of biochemical markers(2). These markers are found inside your body's cells and are needed for their function. When your heart muscle cells are injured, their contents are elevated, including the markers released into your bloodstream. The cardiologist can determine the heart attack's size and approximately when the heart attack started by measuring these markers' levels. 



(c)Echocardiogram (echo): Echo can be used during and after a heart attack to

learn about how the heart is pumping and identify what areas of the heart are not pumping normally. The echo is also valuable to see if any heart structures (valves, septum.) have been injured during the heart attack.


(e)Cardiac catheterization (cath): Cardiac catheterization (cath) may be performed during the first hours of a heart attack if medications are not relieving the ischemia or symptoms. The cardiac cath can visualize the blocked artery directly and guide the choice for which procedure (such as angioplasty, stent placement or coronary artery bypass surgery).

MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT

Heartattack treatment Must begin immediately. Therapy aims to quickly treat, limit heart muscle damage, relieve symptoms, and optimize life expectancy.

Medications: The goals of medication therapy are to break up or prevent t blood clots, prevent platelets from gathering and sticking to the plaque, stabilize the plaque, and prevent further ischemia. Medications must be given as soon as possible (within

30 minutes from the start of heart attack symptoms) to decrease heart muscle damage. The longer the delay in starting these drugs, the more damage that occurs and the less benefit they can provide; in this case, time is heart muscle. Thrombolytic medications are used to break up clots blocking the artery. Medications given right after the start of a heart attack may include: Aspirin；Thrombolytic therapy ("clot busters")；Heparin；Other antiplatelet drugs. Other drugs, given during or after a heart attack, lessen your heart's work, improve the heart's functioning, widen or dilate your blood vessels, decrease your pain, guard against any life-threatening heart rhythms and antagonize the effect of adrenaline/epinephrine. Doctors will prescribe the appropriate medications for you.

Interventional Procedures

During or shortly after a heart attack, you may go to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to directly evaluate the status of the heart, arteries and the amount of heart damage. In some cases, procedures (such as angioplasty or stents) are used to open up your narrowed or blocked arteries. These procedures may be combined with thrombolytic therapy to open up the narrowed arteries and break up any blocking clots.

Coronary artery bypass surgery: If necessary, bypass surgery may be performed to restore the heart muscle's supply of blood.

PREVENTION

There are many actions you can take to reduce your risk of a heart attack:

①Quit smoking. ②Exercise regularly, ③Eat a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean or Dash diets. ④Lose weight if you are overweight.

⑤Manage any current high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. ⑥Keep all your medical appointments and be an active member of your health.

Seeing your healthcare providers regularly can uncover any heart-related issues quickly, and treatment can begin immediately. You don't have to make lifestyle changes all on your own. Ask your doctor for help. We are always here to help you; provide the information you need.
